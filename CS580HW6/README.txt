README.txt file for CS 580 homework 6.
Author: Rachelle Fuhrer
Due Date: Thursday, October 28, 2010

For this assignment, I wanted to keep the project and file names clean by naming everything HW6 or Application6.
I extended my homework 5 assignment to do this. The files that needed altering to support this name change were:
- CS580HWView.cpp (initializes Application6)
- Application6.h (formerly Application5.h)
- Application6.cpp (formerly Application5.cpp)
All of these files have thus been included in my homework submission.

Also, since I extended my HW5 application, I needed to modify the provided Gz.h file to include definitions for GZ_TEXTURE and GzTexture.
I therefore included this file in my submission as well. Note that no other aspect of the Gz.h API was changed.

Finally, the following files were either modified since last assignment or specific to my code:
- Application.h (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- Application.cpp (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- CustomizablePerlinNoise.h (specific to my code base for procedural texturing)
- CustomizablePerlinNoise.cpp (specific to my code base for procedural texturing)
- disp.h (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- disp.cpp (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- rend.h (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- rend.cpp (to support multiple anti-aliasing samples)
- tex_fun.cpp (my specific texture and procedural texture implementation)
- WorleyNoise.h (specific to my code base for procedural texturing)
- WorleyNoise.cpp (specific to my code base for procedural texturing)
